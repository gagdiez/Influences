Influences is a decentralized social network that allow fans to subscribe to their favourite influencers for a monthly fee. Influencers in turn share images and videos.

The main advantage of Influences is that it's completely decentralized. It's front-end is hosted in skynet, the decentralized storage platform of SIA. Moreover, all the content that the influencers upload also goes to skynet! Meanwhile, the back-end is implemented as a smart contract hosted in NEAR (currently in the testnet).
